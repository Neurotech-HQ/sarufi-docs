# Webhook integration

As our PizzaBot has the ability to handle conversations as we need it to, we can add extra functionality to let it interact with other systems, such as databases, APIs, and third-party applications.
This is possible by utilizing Sarufi's webhook functionality to automate workflows. This will make our previous chatbot more powerful and useful. We can integrate webhooks into our chatbot to handle things like payments, update inventories, and update delivery tracking systems.

## Webhooks

A webhook is an HTTP-based callback mechanism that allows two systems to communicate in real-time. It is triggered when an event occurs, such as an order confirmation. When the event is triggered, the webhook sends a request to a specified URL, which can be used to trigger an action, such as updating a database, sending a payment push, updating a delivery system, or sending a message notification.

:::note
Remember that a webhook only communicates one way!
:::

All you have to do is specify which states should trigger the webhook and set the webhook URL in Sarufi.

## Preparationsüõ£

With our PizzaBot, we will set up the webhook to send a person in charge a notification of the new confirmed order.

![Webhook illustration](/img/webhook-illustration.png)

Steps:

- Set up a public URL endpoint. This can be either a webserver or a cloud-hosted web service. Make sure you have a domain name set up.

- Set Trigger Intents

Navigate to the Sarufi dashboard --> `Settings` --> `Webhook`. Select the intents that will trigger sending of data to your webhook URL, then click `save`.

![Sarufi webhook field](/img/sarufi-webhook-setup.png)

- Process received data in your endpoint. This is specific to your setup.

- Optionally, send requests to other services to handle the message.

## Implementationüõ´

An option is to use Flask to set up your server and Twilio to send message notifications to alert the operator when a new order is created.

You can use [Replit](https://replit.com) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to make your server available online. The webhook is based on our PizzaBot we have been working on.

We will make changes in our bot. We will add a choice to let the user confirm the order.

### Adding Choices in the flow

Here is an updated flowchart of our chatbot.

![Updated version of pizza bot](/img/pizz-bot-with-choices.png)

The `choice menu` ensures that the user can only choose from the provided options. In case they enter something else, the `fallback message` will be displayed to the user.

We will modify the message of the bot at the `phone_number` state to let user know that they have to select from the displayed choices.

To add a choice menu, in the Sarufi dashboard navigate to your state which is to be connected to the choice menu. Click the `connect` button --> `Connect to Choice Menu`.
You will have to create a new choice menu A small window will pop up prompting for details. Here are the fields which need to be added:

- Choice name

    Choices start with `choice_`. Our choice will be called `choice_confirmation`.

- Fallback message

    This a message that will be displayed when user choses an invalid choice.

- Add a choice

    Each choice has a `text` and a connected `state`. `text` corresponds to the user input and `state` is the state which the bot will transition to when the user selects that choice.

    1 will be the choice to confirm the order and 2 will be the choice to cancel the order.

    ![Sarufi choice menu](/img/sarufi-choice-menu.png)

    With our choices in place, we need to connect each choice to a state. We will start with choice `1`. Click on `Connect` ‚û°Ô∏è `Create a state` ‚û°Ô∏è and enter a state name, for example *customer_confirms*.

    We will be using a text message component for this. Select `Text component` then add a message like `Thank you for ordering with us, you order will be available soon`. Click **Save** afterwards. Do the same for choice `2`. Finally, click **Save**.

    If everything went successful, it will look like this.

## The Journey‚úàÔ∏è

In our journey, we are going to set up a webhook server. You can use either Ngrok or Replit to make your local server publicly available to the internet.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="replit" label="Replit">

Steps to set up Replit:

### 1. Create repository
  Fork the [PizzaBot sample webhook](https://replit.com/@jovyinny/sarufi-bot-webhook) repository into your Replit account.

### 2. Create secret keys. They are listed in the table below.

  |Secret key| Description|
  |---|---|
  |phone_number|"Your twilio phone number"|
  |twilio_SID|"Your Twilio SID"|
  |twilio_assigned_phone_number|"Youe twilio assigned number"|
  |twilio_auth_token|"Twilio auth token"|

### 3. Obtain the Webhook URL

  Start your Flask server to obtain a public URL. Afterwards, a small web preview window will open up with the URL. It will be in the format of `https://{your repl name}.{your replit usermae}.repl.co`.

### 4. Set up the webhook in Sarufi

  Navigate to the Sarufi dashboard --> `settings` --> `Webhook`. Select the intents which will trigger sending data to your webhook URL. Click `save`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ngrok" label="Ngrok">

Steps to set up Ngrok:

### 1. Run the command below:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jovyinny/sample-webhook.git
    ```

### 2. Install requirements

  There are a few packages required to setup our webhook. We can install them using the command below:

    ```bash
    cd sample-webhook
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Create an `.env` file

  We are going to create an `.env` file to hold our secret keys from Twilio securely. This is not committed into the Git repository to prevent the keys from being leaked.

    ```text
    phone_number="Your twilio phone number"
    twilio_SID="Your Twilio SID"
    twilio_assigned_phone_number="Youe twilio assigned number"
    twilio_auth_token="Twilio auth token"
    ```

### 4. Run the website

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

### 5. Start the Ngrok server

    ```bash
    ./ngrok http 5000
    ```

  **Note:** Ensure that the port number is same as used in `main.py`.

### 6. Finish up

  After running the command, copy the URL Ngrok provides. The url looks like this: `https://xxxxxxxxxxx.ngrok.io`.

### 7. Set sarufi webhook

  With the URL from Ngrok, it's time to set up our new pizza order alert. Navigate to the Sarufi dashboard --> `Settings` --> `Webhook`. Select the intents that will trigger sending data to your webhook URL.
  Click `save`.

</TabItem>

## Code Snippet

Here is a code example to demonstrate the usage of webhooks with Sarufi. It is easy to use webhooks with even multiple intents specified.

The only thing you need to know is the structure of the data being sent when a particular intent is triggered.

```python
import os
from flask import Flask,request
from twilio.rest import Client
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# flask app
app=Flask(__name__)

load_dotenv()
# twilio
client=Client(os.environ.get("twilio_SID"),os.environ.get("twilio_auth_token"))

def send_notification(message:str):
  message = client.messages.create(
    body=message,
    from_=os.environ.get('twilio_assigned_phone_number'),
    to=os.environ.get("phone_number")
  )
  print("Message sent")
  
  
def extract_data(data:dict)->str:
  number_of_pizza=data.get("number_of_pizzas")
  toppings=data.get("pizza_toppings")
  address=data.get("address")
  phone_number=data.get("phone_number")
  
  # formated message
  message=f"üîîNew order alert.\n A customer with phone number {phone_number} has placed an order of {number_of_pizza} pizza with {toppings} toppings to be delivered to {address}"

  return message

@app.route("/new-order",methods=["POST"])
def new_order():
  data=request.get_json()
  if int(data.get("choice_confirmation"))==1:
    print("new order confirmed")
    message=extract_data(data)
    send_notification(message)
  else:
    print("new order cancelled")
  return "Received"


if __name__ == "__main__":
  app(port=5000,debug=True)
```

## Finishüõ¨

With everything set, let's order something from our chatbot.
