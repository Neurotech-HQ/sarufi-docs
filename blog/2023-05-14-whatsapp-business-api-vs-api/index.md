This is a key part of discussion in this article. Here is where you can understand what is meant when someone says "chatbot integration with Whatsapp". Lets get into it.

On automation side, an app provides few automation techniques such as qiuck replies, greeting messages and away messages.
Using API, a business will have ability to do more advanced automations mostly using A.I powered chatbots, connecting whatsapp to CRM, customer care support an much more... The focus though here is discussing on the use of chatbots in whatsapp.

5. Messaging

Whenever a business replies to a user within the 24 hour [customer service window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/messages), that message will be associated with a user-initiated conversation. Businesses can send free-form messages within this 24 hour customer service window. With user initiated conversation, the business can reply without message limits and no content limit(you can use medias here such as images, videos, files,...)

- Business-initiated

    A conversation that initiates a business initiates by sending a user a message outside a 24 hour customer service window.
