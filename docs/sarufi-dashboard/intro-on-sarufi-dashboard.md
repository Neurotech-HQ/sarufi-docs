You can read more on webhooks at [sarufi webhook integration](/docs/integration/general-knowledge.md)

### Conversation History

As your bot gets to interact with users, it needs to be updated on the cases it was never trained on. How can we do this then, you might be asking. The key here is using conversation data to improve our chatbot responses and coverage.

![Sarufi conversation history](/img/sarufi-conversation-history.png)

### Chatbot live test

During development of anything, you would not like to move on without testing the current state of your project. Here comes a cool chatbot live-test feature. This will enable you eliminate any guesswork and ensures that the chatbot you're developing will work as intended

### Media support

Chatbot without some illustration images or videos may not be customer engaging. The dashboard removes the barrier by allowing you to use media such as:-

- images
- videos
- documents
- stickers

This will also work exactly the same way deployed to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or your website chat widget.

### Response validation

In case you feel the need to verify conversation responses to fit what you wanted whether it be a mobile number, email, or date.

The new dashboard got you covered with our response validation feature. You can use default validators or even write your custom validator using [regex](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html)

## Create a Bot

After logging in, navigate to the Dashboard by clicking `Dashboard` tab. Then you can now proceed with creating our new bot.

![Dashboard after Logging in](/img/dashboard-after-log-in.png)

### Create chatbot from scratch

Lets start with drafting our bot from scratch. Building a chatbot from scratch enables us to tailor the way the bot will handle the conversations flow. This options is great for our `pizza bot`.

Click `Create a New Bot` Button >> **Create from scratch**, then fill important information about the your bot.

![Information about the bot](/img/dashboard-create-bot.png)

Here are some things to take note:

- Language selection

    With language selection(currently English and Swahili), you can choose any base language for your bot.
    Your bot will be created with some default intents and flows that you can look at and make some modifications.

- Community visibility

    We provide [sarufi Community playground](https://playground.sarufi.io/community) for developer to showcase what they have been able to create using Sarufi. The toogle button lets you decide to make your chatbot publically available at sarufi Community for people to test.

    Lets leave it **off** as we can share our bot once its completely finished.

- Threshold settings

    Lets talk a bit more about threshold. A threshold indicates how correct a bot's model was able to evaluate user intent(s) and determine the flow. The threshold is a value between 0 and 1.

    Lets assume that the bot has confidence level of about **0.345** on certain user massage. If we set bot's threshold to **0.4**, it will not be able to pick up the intent. So we introduce a fallback message as a fallback message will be the response in case a model evaluates user intent below the threshold set.

    ![Illustration on Threshold](/img/illustration-threshold.png)

    Setting our threshold in general means that if the model confidence on user intent is below the threshold, the bot will fallback to the fallback message or document.

    The fallback can be a simple message (as "Please rephrase your message" or "Please let me know what you mean by saying this") or the bot can be configured to fallback to a document. This is covered in [Creating a bot using Knowledge base](/docs/sarufi-dashboard/create-bot-from-knowledge-base)

*This setting is found in your bot's settings (General Settings)*
