# Sarufi Dashboard

The need to develop chatbots in a faster and convinient way, has brought up a cool tool with sarufi. [Sarufi](https://sarufi.io) has interactive interface to get you started with your chatbot idea.

Developing your chatbot does not have to be time consumimg and causing headaches. With the UI(User Interface) in place, you will be able to use the full power of your idea.

To get working with the dashboard requires no prior knowledge of programming as sarufi does all the heavy stuffs for you. All needed is your idea to get started.

## Dashboard Features

With a dashboard, you can do a lot in a quick way. Lets look at the key features of the dashboard.

### Web Plugin

After developing your chatbot using sarufi, you need to let it get into use in the real world situation. The easiest way can be integrating you bot with your website.

With the dashboard, web integration is achieved within few seconds. All you need to do is to specify your website URL and then easily customize the chat widget however you want  theme/color/font/title and etc.

You will have a code snippet that you paste in HTML page or React/NextJS App. so easy ðŸš€, you now have the bot for your site.

You can see one of the bot integrated into web at [UDICTI](https://udicti.udsm.ac.tz/)

### Webhook Integration

With support of webhook, your bot will have ability to communicate with third-party APIs (payment gateway, CRM, etc) at any point of a conversation.

All you have to do is specify which states should trigger the webhook.

You can read more on webhooks at [sarufi webhook integration](/docs/add-more-features/webhook-integration)

### Conversation History

As your bot gets to interact with users, it needs to be updated on the cases it was never trained on. How can we do this then, you might be asking. The key here is using conversation data to improve our chatbot responses and coverage.

### Chatbot live test

During development of anything, you would not like to move on without testing the current state of your project. Here comes a cool chatbot live-test feature. This will enable you eliminate any guesswork and ensures that the chatbot you're developing will work as intended

### Media support

Chatbot without some illustration images or videos may not be customer engaging. The dashboard removes the barrier by allowing you to use media such as:-

- images
- videos
- documents
- stickers

This will also work exactly the same way deployed to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or your website chat widget.

### Response validation

In case you feel the need to verify conversation responses to fit what you wanted whether it be a mobile number, email, or date.

The new dashboard got you covered with our response validation feature. You can use default validators or even write your custom validator using [regex](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html)

### View dialog Flow tree

With the UI, you will be able to view your bot's  flow tree. This makes the development process more convient as you can visualize the connected intents and flows.

## Start using Dashboard

To get started with this interface, you will need to sign up with [sarufi](https://www.sarufi.io)

![Sarufi home page](/img/sarufi.png)

You can login ðŸ”“ using either **Google** or **Github** account.

## Create a Bot

After logging in, navigate to the Dashboard by clicking `Dashboard` tab. Then you can now proceed with creating our new bot. In creating a bot, you will have two options available:- `creating a bot from scratch` and [creating a bot using knowledge base](/docs/sarufi-dashboard/create-bot-from-knowledge-base).

### Create chatbot from scratch

Lets start with drafting our bot from scratch. Building a chatbot from scratch enables us to tailor the way the bot will handle the conversations flow. This options is great for our `pizza bot`.

Click `Create a New Bot` Button >> **Create from scratch**, then fill important information about the your bot.

![Information about the bot](/img/dashboard-create-bot.png)

Here are some things to take note:

- Language selection

    With language selection(currently English and Swahili), you can choose any base language for your bot.
    Your bot will be created with some default intents and flows that you can look at and make some modifications.

- Threshold settings

    Lets talk a bit more about threshold. A threshold indicates how correctly a bot's model was able to evaluate user intent and determine the flow. The threshold less than 0.5 indicates that your bot was not able to pick up user intent.

    So we introduce a fallback message as a fallback message will be the response in case a model evaluates user intent below the threshold set. This can be any message like "Please rephrase your message" or "Please let me know what you mean by saying this".

    We shall leave the `Toggle button`(Should we use your document as your first priority fallback reply when the user messade hits below threshold?) **off** as we do not have any document available for our bot. The part of using a documents for your bot is covered in [Creating a bot using Knowledge base](/docs/sarufi-dashboard/create-bot-from-knowledge-base)

- Community visibility

    We provide [sarufi Community playground](https://playground.sarufi.io/community) for developer to showcase what they have been able to create using Sarufi. The toogle button lets you decide to make your chatbot publically available at sarufi Community for people to test.

    Lets leave it **off** as we can share our bot once its completely finished.
