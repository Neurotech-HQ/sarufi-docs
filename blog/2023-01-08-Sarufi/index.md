Utlizing the power of Natural Language Processing(NLP), conversational systems become more aware on the context of the user. With most platforms supporting Other languages leaving behind some unexplored languages such as swahili, **Sarufi** from Neurotech picks up the task.

## What is a ChatBot?

In a growing technology world, you might have already heard or interacted with chatbots as I talked about in above section. Probably, you might have interacted with one while surfing through the internet as most website use them to deliver quick customer service. Let we have a quick grasp of knowledge on `what a chatbot is?`.

A **`Chatbot`** is a computer program that simulates human-like conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded in messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Messanger. Chatbots are built in a way that can detect what one intends to mean.

With chatbot usage increasing globally, business adopt the technology in order to reduce oprational cost, enhance and improve customer engagement thus improving overall business services oferred.
Most customers would like a quick support whenever they visit business platforms for inquiries. This has forced most of business to adopt the use of chatbots.

## Wrap Up

As I wrap up, I would like to clear some differences about `Conversational A.I` and `Chatbot`.
Conversational A.I(Artificial Intelligence) refers to tools/technologies that allow computer to carry out conversational experience with people. As for Cahtbots, they can be `Rule Based` or `A.I based(conversational)`. A Conversatonal Chatbots leverages the use of machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing(NLP) in order to understand the intents unlike Rule Based Chatbots which works as Tree-diagrams such as Automated Phone Menu
