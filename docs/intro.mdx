# What is Sarufi?

At Sarufi, we're on a mission to empower African developers to build chatbots and conversational experiences that are tailored to African languages. We believe that language is at the core of communication, and our goal is to **democratize natural language processing tools** around African languages.

With our **lightweight** and **blazingly fast** platform, you can build chatbots and integrate them with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, **without worrying about the complexities of natural language processing**. We handle all the **heavy lifting**, including **intent detection**, **entity recognition**, **natural language understanding**, and **intent fulfillment**, so that you can **focus on building your bot**.

Our vision is to **transform the way customers engage with businesses in Africa**, by making it easier to create innovative conversational experiences. Join us on our journey to build the **future of conversational AI** that truly represents the **diversity** of African languages.
