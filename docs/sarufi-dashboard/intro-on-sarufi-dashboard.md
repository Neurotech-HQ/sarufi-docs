## Dashboard Features

With a dashboard, you can do a lot in a quick way. Lets look at the key features of the dashboard.

### Web Plugin

After developing your chatbot using sarufi, you need to let it get into use in the real world situation. The easiest way can be integrating you bot with your website.

With the dashboard, web integration is achieved within few seconds. All you need to do is to specify your website URL and then easily customize the chat widget however you want  theme/color/font/title and etc.

You will have a code snippet that you paste in HTML page or React/NextJS App. so easy 🚀, you now have the bot for your site.

### Webhook Integration

With support of webhook, your bot will have ability to communicate with third-party APIs (payment gateway, CRM, etc) at any point of a conversation.

All you have to do is specify which states should trigger the webhook.

### Conversation History

As your bot gets to interact with users, it needs to be updated on the cases it was never trained on. How can we do this then, you might be asking. The key here is using conversation data to improve our chatbot responses and coverage.

### Media support

Chatbot without some illustration images or videos may not be customer engaging. The dashboard removes the barrier by allowing you to use media such as:-

- images
- videos
- documents
- stickers

This will also work exactly the same way deployed to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or your website chat widget.
